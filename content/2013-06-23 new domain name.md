Excerpt: A run-through of how to host a static blog on S3.

### Moving to Amazon S3 &Raquo;

I recently updated my version of Pelican to the most recent version. Pelican is a static blog engine written in Python that converts Markdown or ReStructured Text into html. It supports user-customizable themes and templating using Jinja2?, a powerful Python template engine. 

Apart from the addition of new features such as Python 3 support and archiving functionality it also fixed minor bugs and improved overall reliability. Furthermore, the plugins that were shipped with the canonical version of Pelican are now maintained in a separate repository, which hopefully will encourage the community (including myself) to develop additional modular plugins to extend Pelican's current functionality. I myself am particularly interested in writing plugins for Mendeley, Figshare and ORCID which can be accessed via APIs.
