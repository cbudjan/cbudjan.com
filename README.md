# Github repo for cbudjan.com

This repo contains all source and theme files for my personal weblog [cbudjan.com](http://cbudjan.com).  
The website is generated using the static blog engine [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), which is based on [Python](http://python.org).  
The generated .html files are not included in this repo.
